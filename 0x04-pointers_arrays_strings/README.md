# 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

---

### [0. 98 Battery st.](./0-reset_to_98.c)
* Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### [1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](./1-swap.c)
* Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

### [2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](./2-strlen.c)
* Write a function that returns the length of a string.

### [3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](./3-puts.c)
* Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### [4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](./4-print_rev.c)
* Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### [5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](./5-rev_string.c)
* Write a function that reverses a string.

### [6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](./6-puts2.c)
* Write a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.

### [7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half](./7-puts_half.c)
* Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### [8. Arrays are not pointers](./8-print_array.c)
* Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### [9. strcpy](./9-strcpy.c)
* Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
