# 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions 
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

### [0. isupper](./0-isupper.c)
* Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

### [1. isdigit](./1-isdigit.c)
* Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

### [2. Collaboration is multiplication](./2-mul.c)
* Write a function that multiplies two integers.

### [3. The numbers speak for themselves](./3-print_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

### [4. I believe in numbers and signs](./4-print_most_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Do not print 2 and 4.

### [5. Numbers constitute the only universal language](./5-more_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

### [6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line](./6-print_line.c)
* Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### [7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe](./7-print_diagonal.c)
* Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

### [8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch](./8-print_square.c)
* Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

### [9. Fizz-Buzz](./9-fizz_buzz.c)
* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### [10. Triangles](./10-print_triangle.c)
* Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
